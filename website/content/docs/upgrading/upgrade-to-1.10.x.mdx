# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.10.x compared to 1.9. Please read it carefully.

## SSH Secrets Engine

The new default value of `algorithm_signer` for SSH CA roles has been changed
to `rsa-sha2-256` from `ssh-rsa`. Existing roles will be migrated to
explicitly specify the `algorithm_signer=ssh-rsa` for RSA keys if they used
the implicit (empty) default, but newly created roles will use the new default
value (preferring `rsa-sha2-256`.
